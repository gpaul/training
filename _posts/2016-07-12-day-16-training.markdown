Early gym day! I started with a 5x100m swim then did 3x12 wide pushups, 5x5 hamstring machine stuff (8kg today) and 3x12 backhand curls with 3kg weight and 1x12 with 5kg weights. I threw in 12 upside-down situps where you hook your feet at about shoulder height and lie upside down with your back against a slightly onhanging plank/bench thing.

Solid start to the day. Jes and I went to Hudson's last night and although it was delicious, I ate a shitload. I even took the last of the salted caramel milkshake we shared as dessert (jes insists this was a sneaky play by me while she looked up for a second, but truth is I was digging in at a constant but high rate anyway! :D )
