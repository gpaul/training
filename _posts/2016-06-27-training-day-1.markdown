I woke up at 05:45. It was cold and dark and I could hear the rain on the balcony. I'd anticipated that I would want to sleep in. I reached across and picked up my training pants, shirt, beanie, jersey and socks off the floor and put them on under the covers. I pulled the covers up and tried to get as hot as I could by shivering. It worked and soon enough I was so hot I really didn't want to stay in bed. At 06:00 I strolled pulled out in my bakkie and headed to the Neelsie climbing wall.

The rain dropped to a drizzle as I walked from my car to the wall. I hopped over the wall and got to business. I've got an annoying finger injury that is at a level where I can climb decently hard after warming up properly but I certainly can't pull anywhere near my limit. I decided that today I was going to rest my left middle finger and only use my other fingers to climb.

Not using one's middle finger is tricky. My climbing style is built around having a strong middle finger. I realised that today. If you just try to not use it you inevitably fail by reaching for a crimp you can't hold and your middle finger immediately shoots out to help. Such uncontrolled usage is exactly what I wanted to avoid this morning. I decided to tape it up.

The middle finger on the right hand soon followed once I felt how weak the other fingers on my left hand was. It was like being an absolute beginner. I could barely hang onto large crimps and tired out very quickly. That's SICK! How cool is that?! It's way easier to strengthen a weak muscle than to beef up one that's already strong. That means that I can improve my climbing dramatically by strengthening my other fingers and give my middle fingers a break at the same time. BAM!

I was pretty sore from the weekend eventhough I didn't climb much. As such I skipped my usual pinch hangs and just did a bunch of pull-ups favouring my right arm (left arm bicep was really feeling it,) crunches, bridges, push-ups (asymmetric and symmetric with elbows in tight) and a bunch of hangs. I probably climbed around on really easy stuff (without using my middle fingers) for about 30 minutes prior to the cross-training.

After work I went for a quick run in the foothills of Stellenbosch mountain. Not long (8km), not fast (1h) and not hard (146m up, 146 down.) It was beautiful though with the slightest drizzle cooling the air and softening the dirt roads. Dusk turned into night and the clouds started parting towards the end of the run revealing stars and a crisp night sky.

Another great day.
