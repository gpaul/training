I forgot to update the blog and now I can't remember exactly what training I did. I think Tuesday was spent on stretches and foam-roller / rolling out my feet, etc.

Wednesday I put some weight on my back and did pullups (18kgs, 5 sets of 5 pullups with 1 minute of rest in between.) This was great training and I'll definitely do more of it in the future. I may go a bit heavier next time.

Thursday I did some good stretching again as well as lots of leg training.
