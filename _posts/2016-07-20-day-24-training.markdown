I've had a good rest - mostly due to struggling with too little sleep and too much coffee. Even if I'd been training I'm not sure it would have been better, my traps and lats only started relaxing after a couple of days of resting anyway.

Today I did some weighted pullups again, 4x4 with 22.5kg. I also did some cool lunges where I try and straighten onto my front leg as fast as possible, kicking my back knee to my chest while carrying a 20kg weight in each hand. It felt like really good training for the legs and I was dizzy within minutes.

I also did a set of 5 upside down situps with a medicine ball held above my head. That was a bit intense - not sure my lower back appreciated that - but I think I stopped before any damage was done, feeling fit and chipper tonight.

I did 5x15 pushups, then went for a 5x100m swim.

Good day.
