In rocklands for the weekend! Willem Basson and I spent the day at Riverside. We tried Nymph again - I am now convinced that it starts at the two good crimps in the middle of the face instead of from the block. Starting from the block is *way* harder than 6c+. Maybe if you have incredible pinch strength you might be under the illusion that going straight up to the overhanging pinch might be 6c+, but there's no way. It's more like 7a+. Also, all the moves following the move from the low block are way, way easier which makes the route feel very inconsistent. I prefer starting at the two crimps and I think 6c/6c+ isn't unreasonable from there.

I hung on the first few moves of dragonfly traverse and promptly decided it's not for me. I'll have a look at Bernd Zangerl's send of it again - maybe it is very beta intensive. The first two or three moves all felt incredibly difficult!

George joined us at the wailing wall and Ivor took some amazing pics: https://www.instagram.com/p/BHb5kSzDTIL/?taken-by=apiegram&hl=en

Great day of climbing.
