Another lovely morning in rocklands! I did a very cool dyno problem on the way to john denver today. I've looked at it for a long time and never saw the massive left hand starting hold around the corner. Cool!

I did john denver second go (first go was so scrappy I just stepped off and started again.) That's encouraging as I've struggled with it in the past and now it felt really easy.
