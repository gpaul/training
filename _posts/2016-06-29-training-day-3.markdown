Still stiff but felt much better. I didn't go training at the wall as my finger is feeling on the verge of improving and I really don't want to screw it up.

At least my diet was very good today and yesterday.

I'm going to give it one more day - I'm going to Rocklands again this weekend and I really really want to give my finger some time. I'll do pullups and pushups tomorrow and maybe go for a good swim.

This is a failure day, not a rest day. I'm trying to figure out what triggered this. The thought process this morning was "I really don't want to bust my finger, so I'm not going to the wall. But if I'm not going to the wall, I'll just sleep in. Work.Work. Ok I'm home again but I'm making dinner. Now I've got mountain rescue training, now its really late and I need to go to bed."

Looking back I should have got up and trained anyway - just not my finger. Tonight's going to be a late night as I've got some overseas calls so I'll only get to sleep past midnight. That means I won't get up early enough for training tomorrow.

How do I recover from that? I'm going to get my swimming kit ready - I need to buy a new cap - and go swimming and cross training at the gym right after work. That should work. Tomorrow night is dinner at the parents' so I don't need to worry about making dinner.

Psyched!
