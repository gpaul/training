Joined the Coetzenburg gym today. I've got a month. I joined because they have a (heated indoor) swimming pool and since I'm not quite up to running every day yet I figured I'd do some swimming to get my cardio in.

I had loads of fun with the jelly half-ball thing. I did one-legged jumps onto it where I hop on, keep my balance for a few seconds, then step off. I eventually upgraded this to jumping on and landing on only the toes of one foot.

I did some very steady slow turkish getups using a 12kg kettle bell, three each side. Those things are beautiful. I did more elbows-tucked-in-palms-outward pushups. I did some dips, I did some pull-ups. I focused on doing all these slow and very controlled. I should probably train some fast stuff, too - but my feeling is that climbing isn't "slow twitch" or "fast twitch" exclusively. It's mostly slow controlled lock-offs or movements followed by lots of "catching yourself as you fall." As such, I'm opting for slow and controlled movements as they're less likely to leave me injured.

I hopped on this contraption that you hook your feet to near head-height then hang down a board with your head at the bottom and do sit-ups. Seriously great lower stomach excersize!

Another fun thing has these two horizontal pads where you put your elbows and handles for your hands, then you do leg-lifts, also very cool.

I ended with a 200m swim. Righteous.

## Training Summary

20 elbows-in pushups
